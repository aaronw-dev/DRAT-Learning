## Inspiration
This project is inspired by our teacher who introduced to a new way of learning, 
His method had us read and research our homework and then decode it in class with him.
Thanks to him we acquired the best ultimate study method and we want to share with the world.

## What it does

D.R.A.T. allows you to create byte cards that are summarized google searches of your topic.
You choose a topic to search about, the D.R.A.T. will search it for you and summarize/paraphrase into notes for you to use in making flash cards (PS flash card algorithm not implemented right now) .

## How we built it

We used Firebase to authenticate users and store their bytes and to Firestore Database Collections.
We also used APIs to run the search algorithm to the web scraping algorithm and the text summariser.

## Challenges we ran into

-It was hard finding and easy to use API.
-Integrating multiple separate system altogether in 1 system.
-Trying to make the website look clean.
-limitation of customization with the APIs and algorithms.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of creating a database that is automatically linked to a website that update in real time based on what we want. As well as the base of the future of D.R.A.T 

## What we learned

When creating custom algorithms and APIs its best to start from scratch to get what you want and to make life easier. It is also best to code with a flexible time frame to ensure the best quality.

## What's next for D.R.A.T. Learning

Building our Flask card system
Creating our own APIs and systems for the best performance
As well as other features to help students and teachers research and educate/learn better (for example;
customised learning guides for students created by D.R.A.T for the teacher to use with customised notes for each student) etc.
And Launching D.R.A.T. v1.0 soon
